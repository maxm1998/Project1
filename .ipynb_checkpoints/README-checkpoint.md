# Part 1 Introduction and Data

Looking at covid, financial and health data to find out how Covid-19 has impacted the world and to find any correlations between different variables.

Data sources:
Google Finance: google sheets for stock, index, fx data
John Hopkins: Covid Data
IMF: GDP data
Kaggle: Commodity prices

What we did with the data:
Concatenating and grouping data into groups, such as fx sectors, indices, countries and dealing with a lot of date data types, using Pandas functions such as groupby...
Used Pycountry (API with list of country names and data) to check our dataframes and validate country names
Covid data from different countries can be unreliable (for example Laos only has 40 cases)  so a way to filter out outliers is to only look at countries within a certain range 
of some variable such as fatality_rate

<br>

> **Are there any correlation between between the covid case numbers vs the stringency index**
    
<br>


<br>

> **Are there countries that are stringent in their response to covid and have positive GDP growth with increasing number of covid cases? If so, whom are these countries and their metrics?**
    
<br>


<br>

> **Are there countries that are the opposite to the above? List them and their metrics.**
